# 📊 Sales Prediction with Hybrid Model (RandomForest + XGBoost)

This is my  machine learning project, focused on predicting outlet sales using a hybrid ensemble model combining RandomForest and XGBoost. The system features a real-time user interface built with Gradio and allows users to export results in PDF, Excel, and CSV formats.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Real-time sales prediction using hybrid ML model  
- Input fields: Outlet ID, Establishment Year, Outlet_Age_Sales_Interaction  
- Instant prediction output with pie chart  
- Export options: PDF, Excel (XLSX), and CSV  
- Built with Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Gradio, Matplotlib, FPDF


## 📈 Model Performance

✅ The hybrid model achieved an **R² score of 1.00** on the test set — indicating a perfect fit on the prediction task.
